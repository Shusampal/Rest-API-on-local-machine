# Rest-API-on-local-machine
This is a restful API which is hosted on local machine . It supports methods as GET , POST  , PATCH , DELETE.

This data is not fetched from any API but I have collected this data from internet and used POST method to insert into mongo DB.

This API is not hosted and is only available on local machine . 

I have tested this API using postman.

This API gives the information of the top 5 100m sprint Atheletes around the world . Data is taken by ranking.
